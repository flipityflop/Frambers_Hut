# Frambers_Hut

1. download this file, save it to wherever


2. download and install python if you dont have it. [IMPORTANT: make sure to toggle the 'add to path' option during installation]


3. open powershell. use the start menu to search for it, then run it


4. ok this is the tricky bit:
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
      a. go to the location where you downloaded the folder.
      
      b. select the folder Frambers_Hut [not the files inside, but the parent folder]
      
      c. at the top, in the 'Home' tab, there's a little button called 'Copy Path'. select that
      
      d. now back in powershell, type 'cd' [without the parantheses], a space, and paste the path you just copied
      
      e. hit enter
  
    what you should see is that the the start of line (where you cant type) will change, probably get longer
    
    you are now running any commands within that folder
 
 
5. type  'python' [without parenthese], space, and 'Frambers_Hut.py' [...]. hit enter and the game should start



if you can't figure those steps out, then try googling the following things:
  
  'how to install python on windows'
  
  'how to navigate to a folder in powershell' or try 'cd command in powershell'
  
  'how to run a python script in windows'
